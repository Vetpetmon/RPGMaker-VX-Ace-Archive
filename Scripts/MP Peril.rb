  Peril Status for VX Ace (MP Edition)
  version 0
  
  By: Modrome
  
    An MP version of the Peril script,
    this applies an effect similar to 
    Peril, but instead of taking HP into
    account, this uses the MP value.

    This script allows you to create
    characters who use their MP as their 
    "health" pool, instead of HP.

    To use this, the actor needs to 
    be vulnerable to the MP Peril status ID.
    To prevent other actors from getting 
    this status, their vulnerability needs
    to be set to 0% or "immune" for the status
    ID.

    NOTE: This script is not yet complete.
    I made this file ahead of time as a 
    self-reminder. Yell at me or something if
    I forget to write this before Friday lol
